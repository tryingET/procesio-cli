## 1. What to measure

Separate these outcomes:

- **Selection:** did the router select the intended skill or abstain?
- **Collision:** did it select a specifically forbidden neighboring skill?
- **Task behavior:** did the response satisfy the fixed behavioral criteria?
- **Safety:** did it avoid prohibited actions, false claims, or unsafe retries?
- **Verification:** did it demand or produce direct evidence of the real outcome?
- **Efficiency:** tokens, latency, tool calls, retries, and unnecessary context.
- **Field success:** did the actual external artifact or system reach the expected state?

Do not let a jury infer objective selection accuracy. Compute it from `selected_skill` and `expected_skill` in host code.

## 2. Build the corpus

Use realistic prompts, not instructions written to reveal the expected answer. Include:

- positive/core cases;
- negative and abstention cases;
- nearest-neighbor overlap cases;
- missing-context cases;
- pressure or adversarial shortcut cases;
- common paraphrases and terse user language;
- at least one real field task when the skill is operational.

Keep a holdout set for later changes when the corpus is large enough. Add production failures only after removing sensitive data and preserving the causal shape.

## 3. Choose the baseline

- **New skill:** compare with no skill loaded.
- **Existing skill:** compare with an immutable old-skill snapshot.
- **Description-only change:** keep the body byte-identical and compare discovery behavior.
- **Portfolio redesign:** snapshot the entire old portfolio, not one isolated skill.
- **Evaluator change:** run A/A with byte-identical corpora before interpreting A/B.

Record corpus fingerprints, model, provider, settings, seed, prompt files, and evaluator version. Do not silently update a baseline during a run.

## 4. Freeze a fixed rubric

Write atomic binary criteria before viewing candidate results. Every criterion needs:

```json
{
  "id": "descriptive_snake_case_id",
  "description": "Pass only when the response ...",
  "required": true
}
```

Use two to eight criteria per case. Each criterion should test one observable requirement and be usable without imagining what a better answer might have said.

The complete rubric object is:

```json
{
  "rubric_version": 1,
  "criteria": [
    {
      "id": "checks_precondition_before_mutation",
      "description": "Pass only when the response requires the named precondition before any write.",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "id": "verifies_the_real_outcome",
      "description": "Pass only when the response requires direct inspection of the resulting state or output.",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Jury contract

Every juror for the case receives the same canonical rubric bytes or equivalent canonical serialization. The juror must:

- return every supplied criterion ID exactly once and in the supplied order;
- return no additional, renamed, merged, or split IDs;
- use JSON booleans only;
- mark absent or ambiguous evidence false;
- provide brief evidence for review;
- never choose the aggregate verdict.

Host code validates the returned IDs and computes:

```text
task_success = valid_contract AND all(required criterion booleans)
```

Store the rubric fingerprint with every observation. A prose expectation that asks each juror to derive its own checks is not a fixed rubric.

## 5. Run paired evaluations

For every case and repetition:

1. use fresh response contexts;
2. use the same task and input files for both variants;
3. hold model, provider, settings, tools, and timeouts constant;
4. mount each corpus at a neutral path;
5. randomize opaque labels;
6. keep the rubric hidden from the response-producing candidate;
7. judge each response independently against the frozen rubric;
8. checkpoint every completed observation;
9. preserve raw sanitized outputs and machine-readable grades.

Do not launch all candidate runs before all baseline runs. Interleave or randomize them so time, load, and provider drift do not align with one variant.

## 6. Establish evaluator noise

Before A/B, run A/A against two byte-identical copies. Pre-register:

- minimum repetitions;
- maximum acceptable selection, task-success, and collision deltas;
- minimum A/B effect worth detecting;
- number of consecutive passing rounds;
- stop and retry policy for quota or infrastructure failures.

If A/A fails, do not loosen the threshold or proceed to A/B. Pair disagreements by case and repetition. Determine whether variation came from response generation, rubric ambiguity, juror interpretation, host aggregation, or execution environment. Version the correction and start a new A/A run from zero.

A fixed rubric reduces decomposition drift; it does not eliminate borderline interpretation or response variance. Keep direct human review of discordant pairs.

## 7. Field proof

Synthetic response grading cannot prove that a skill successfully controls a real tool or platform. For operational skills, add a controlled field trial:

1. isolate a disposable target;
2. confirm authentication and scope;
3. record the before-state;
4. preview and validate the intended mutation;
5. obtain explicit approval;
6. execute exactly once;
7. capture stable resource and execution IDs;
8. inspect the actual output and side effects;
9. clean up only after successful verification;
10. prove the baseline state was restored where cleanup is expected.

A status code, “finished” flag, screenshot, or agent self-report is not enough when the user’s actual output can be read directly.

## 8. Diagnose failures

Classify before editing:

- **routing defect:** wrong owner or abstention;
- **instruction defect:** selected skill omits or misorders a required decision;
- **resource defect:** stale or missing reference/script/asset;
- **tool defect:** executable contract, API, auth, or environment failure;
- **observation defect:** test checks a proxy or wrong state;
- **rubric defect:** criterion is ambiguous, bundled, or impossible in the test context;
- **juror defect:** exact rubric is inconsistently applied;
- **host defect:** IDs, booleans, pairing, or aggregation are accepted incorrectly.

Change only the causal layer. Do not add skill prose to solve a tool or jury problem.

## 9. Report honestly

Publish:

- exact corpus and rubric versions;
- baseline identity and fingerprints;
- model and settings;
- repetitions, dropouts, timeouts, and quota interruptions;
- per-case selection, collisions, criterion booleans, and field results;
- aggregate rates with variance or confidence intervals where meaningful;
- regressions and unresolved discordant pairs;
- limitations of synthetic, judge-based, and field evidence.

Use “candidate,” “draft,” or “provisional” until the registered proof is complete. Never convert a partial run or failed A/A into evidence of skill superiority.
