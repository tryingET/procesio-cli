# Form end-to-end verification

## Goal

Create or change a PROCESIO form and prove the user-visible behavior, process triggers, and runtime diagnostics—not merely the form DTO.

## Preconditions

- Identify workspace, form ID or create intent, public/private access, target URL, user roles, bound variables, triggered processes, and expected behavior per control/event.
- Ensure the `web` optional dependency/browser is installed and a dedicated saved session exists when authentication is required.
- Use isolated test data and avoid another person's active browser profile.

## Inspect

1. Fetch the form definition, custom URL, publication/access state, bound processes, and referenced data models.
2. Inventory tabs, controls, required fields, defaults, dynamic data, upload limits, and events (`onLoad`, submit, click, input, focus/blur, row/pagination events where present).
3. Read expected process input mappings and resulting user-visible states.
4. For a synchronous `RUN_PROCESS` event with output mappings, inspect the exact process-variable IDs, the form field paths, the process custom-response mapping, one real process variable-instance shape, and the runtime writer contract. A custom response that is useful to an API caller is not automatically compatible with the form's native output-map writer.
5. When form JavaScript installs persistent UI behavior, confirm its listeners/timers execute in the parent document realm rather than only in the transient trigger sandbox.

## Preview and approval

- Build/edit through the structured form DTO and inspect its dry-run output where available.
- Show access changes, event-triggered writes, notifications, and public exposure before saving or publishing.
- A screenshot mockup is not approval to create or publish a live form.
- State the number of expected external submissions and the complete process-instance tree each submission may create.

## Execute

- Save the form once, re-fetch it, then open the intended URL with the `web` tool.
- Exercise every changed control and event using stable labels/selectors rather than coordinates.
- Test normal, required/empty, invalid, boundary, and role/access paths relevant to the change.
- For native synchronous result rendering, preserve existing direct process outputs and caller semantics. When the runtime writer consumes a variable-instance collection, use a compatible response envelope rather than replacing the established structured response.
- Never persist an access token or credential as a form default, in plaintext JavaScript, or in screenshots/logs.

## Verify

Pass only when all relevant layers agree:

1. Saved DTO matches intended controls, mappings, events, and access.
2. Browser interaction reaches the expected visible state with no page error, console error, failed request, or unexpected 4xx/5xx from the form's own calls.
3. Triggered processes create the expected parent/child instances and outputs/side effects.
4. A synchronous output-map claim is proven by one real native form action: submit/click once, inspect the actual response, and observe the fields update automatically. Do not call the SPA's writer manually, patch the DOM, replay the request, or substitute a previously completed instance.
5. Output-map rows still reference the intended process variable IDs after any process edit, and direct CLI/subprocess callers still receive their established response contract.
6. Reload/back/navigation and repeated submission behavior are understood; duplicate submission is prevented or handled.
7. Private/public access behaves as designed in an appropriate session.
8. Screenshots mask secret fields and evidence confirms no secret default or embedded clear token exists.

## Recovery and cleanup

Close only the browser/session started for verification. Remove test submissions and temporary fixtures where policy permits; never erase evidence needed to diagnose a failure. Revert publication/access immediately if exposure is broader than intended.

When the form writes the right backend state but fails to render the native response, keep the field gate failed: preserve the successful instance/row, inspect the real response and writer contract, repair the smallest compatible process/form layer, and submit only once under a separately approved remediation key.

## Evidence

Return form ID and URL, controls/events covered, screenshots or DOM text where useful, browser diagnostics summary, exact submit count, parent/child process instance IDs, actual response shape, native output-map result, side-effect proof, secret-exposure checks, and untested device/access paths.
