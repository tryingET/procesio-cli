# Using PROCESIO: the rules that are not obvious

**Generated from the notes in this folder. Do not edit by hand.**
Regenerate with `python scripts/run-tool.py procesio usage-guide`.

Every rule below was learned by losing time to it against the live platform,
and they share a shape: the call succeeds, the status says finished, nothing
is logged, and the thing you asked for did not happen. That is what makes
them expensive. There is no error to search for, so you look in the wrong
place.

None of these is a defect report. Each is the platform doing something
defensible that reads as a failure until you know the rule.

This page carries the rule and a pointer. The reasoning, the measurement and
the worked example stay in the note it points at, one copy, so a correction
lands in exactly one place and this page follows on the next build.

**58 rules across 3 notes.**
